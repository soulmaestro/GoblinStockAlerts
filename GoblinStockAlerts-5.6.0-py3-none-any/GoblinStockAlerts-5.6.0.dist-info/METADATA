# GoblinStockAlerts ðŸ’°ðŸš€

GoblinStockAlerts (GSA) is a **self-hosted** project for monitoring the World of Warcraft Auction House API.

For the most hardcore, there is an additional (and optional) 'Sniper' addon component that will give you the ability to
rapidly purchase the discovered items in-game.

### Changelog

All notable changes can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/binaryhabitat/GoblinStockAlerts/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Why?

Closed-source, private tools being used in a video game is anti-competitive. The skill should be in your decisions
analyzing what is, and isn't a deal, not down to the tool you use. Some tools being used by the Goblin community are
giving a significant competitive edge to people and GSA aims to _help_ level the playing field. It doens't solve it by
any means but I hope it helps. Blizzard needs to intervene, but until they do, enjoy API sniping.

Additionally, GSA is aimed at bridging a gap between those who use existing services (such
as [TradeSkillMaster](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/) or [The Undermine Journal](https://theunderminejournal.com/))
and those using private closed-source applications written by various Auction House Goblins ðŸ’°.

This does not mean that absolutely no technical ability is needed, a small amount of technical aptitude **is**
required to set GSA up.

### Cost

GSA auction scanner and addon will always be open source. Because it's self-hosted, there are no cloud costs - Therefore
it's free, now, and forever. Enjoy.

### Demo

Images say a thousand words, this is an example run of the main scanner component.

### Setup

- Documentation (Python Scanner) [here](https://github.com/binaryhabitat/GoblinStockAlerts/tree/master/documentation/SETUP_PYTHON.md).
- Documentation (Configurations) [here](https://github.com/binaryhabitat/GoblinStockAlerts/tree/master/documentation/SETUP_CONFIGURATION.md).
- Documentation (Sniper Addon) [here](https://github.com/binaryhabitat/GoblinStockAlerts/tree/master/documentation/SETUP_ADDON.md).

### Issues

Lastly, GSA is written by people who are not Auction House Goblins ðŸ’°, TSM users, or any other type of market
connoisseurs. When submitting issues / feature requests please ELI5 (_Explain Like I'm 5_)

- GSA was originally made as a side project for 'the lazy town kid'.

Due to the intended audience of GSA issues can be reported on
Discord: [https://discord.gg/UeX7RekyUq](https://discord.gg/UeX7RekyUq).

### Disclaimer

GoblinStockAlerts is an additional tool in your arsenal to make gold. It is designed to assist, **not** attempt to
replace any of the traditional tools such as TSM/TUJ.

Reinforcing the 'AS-IS' part of the LGPL license. You can inspect every element of the code being provided due to its
open source nature, and therefore any decisions on how you spend your gold in World of Warcraft remain yours.

___The code is not yet production quality or optimized. It is in an "it works, spaghetti" state, this will improved over
time - help appreciated.___

### Python absolutely sucks for concurrency!

It does, in addition this project was also written in a rush. However, Python is the most widely accessible language in
the world. Therefore, it is hoped that it is easy for others to contribute, review and improve.
