This is a collection of WoW addons know as, and used by, GSA or GoblinStockAlerts

These were, and some might still be, available through github and pypi

Because of the open license, I made this available again.
The code has not (yet) been updated to the new 3rd party or in game API and as such this will not work as this is now made available.
